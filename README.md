# Covid â€“ Charts

## About

Project in Python that displays the statistics and graphs of the coronavirus for the countries and worldwide. 
I used the pandas, matplotlib and seaborn library to show data.
In this project you can download the latest data from https://www.ecdc.europa.eu and check the statistics and graphs about:
+ Total number of cases and deaths worldwide and in selected countries,
+ 5 countries with the highest number of cases and deaths in the world,
+ 10 random countries with total number of cases and deaths over months,
+ 5 countries with the highest death / case rates in the world,
+ Total number of cases and deaths in months in the world and in selected countries,
+ The total number of cases and deaths in the selected countries in the last 14 days.
